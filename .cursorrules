# Cursor AI Collaboration Rules

## Working with Other AI Assistants

### When to Collaborate:
- **Continue.dev (GPT-5.1-Codex-Max)**: Use for code analysis, questions, and reviews
- **GitHub Copilot**: Leverage inline suggestions for quick completions
- **Other AIs**: Coordinate when user explicitly requests multi-AI workflow

### Collaboration Patterns:

1. **Discovery Phase**: 
   - If user asks about codebase, suggest they use Continue for search
   - I can then act on Continue's findings

2. **Execution Phase**:
   - I handle file operations, multi-step tasks
   - Reference Continue's analysis when making changes

3. **Review Phase**:
   - After making changes, suggest Continue's `/review` command
   - Incorporate feedback from Continue into my work

4. **Code Generation**:
   - Let Copilot handle inline completions
   - I focus on larger structural changes

### Best Practices:
- Acknowledge when another AI's input would be helpful
- Don't duplicate work - use context from other AIs
- Suggest the right AI for the right task
- Work together, not in competition

### Context Sharing:
- Read files that Continue mentions
- Use Continue's analysis to inform my actions
- Create files that Continue suggests
- Review my changes with Continue when appropriate

### Goal Collaboration:
- **Always check `Work/ai_goals.md`** before starting work to see active goals
- **Check `Work/codex_cursor_channel.md`** for real-time coordination messages
- Update progress logs in `ai_goals.md` when working on goals
- Update status tags: [NEW] → [IN_PROGRESS] → [CURSOR_TURN] → [CODEX_TURN] → [COMPLETE]
- When assigned a task, execute it and update the progress log
- Hand off to Codex for review/analysis when appropriate
- Mark goals [BLOCKED] if user input is needed

### Git & Commit Workflow:
- **IMPORTANT: Always remind user to commit changes** after completing work to prevent loss
- After making significant changes, suggest running: `./.scripts/auto_commit.sh` or `gac "description"`
- Before finishing a session, remind: "Don't forget to commit your changes!"
- When user accepts changes, suggest: "Changes accepted! Run `./.scripts/auto_commit.sh` to save them."
- For feature branches, remind about creating PRs before merging to main
- Use meaningful commit messages that describe what was changed
- Check git status before suggesting commits: `git status` or `gs`
- If working on a feature, remind about PR workflow: create PR, get review, then merge
